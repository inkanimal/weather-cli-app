# Weather

## Description

This is a weather CLI application that will scrape weather data from weather.com
based on the user's input of a zip code. It will return a list of weather data that the user can then choose from, to see specific weather conditions for their area.

## Install Instructions

You will need Ruby installed on your computer to run this program. If they are not already installed, you will need to download and install the Nokogiri and Open-Uri Ruby Gems. After grabbing the necessary gems, clone a copy of this repo onto your computer and run the file. Follow the instructions on the command line interface to enter your zip code and receive the weather data for your location.
